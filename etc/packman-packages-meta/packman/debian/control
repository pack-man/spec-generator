Description: End-to-End Software Packaging Platform
 Packman intends to relieve the development team from the requirement of having 
 .
 packaging expertise by automating most of the work and providing guided package
 .
 generation wizards when manual intervention is necessary.
 .
 Once package specifications have been defined, the platform will build the 
 .
 packages on all target platforms, run sanity [acceptance] 
 .
 tests and distribute the packages to a repository dedicated for the project.
 .
 This allows development teams to focus on what they do best: write software; 
 .
 and frees them from manual labour on packaging and distribution.
