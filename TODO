- Packman package:
 - create packman user, sudoer for docker command - DONE
 - create these dirs under ~packman/rpmbuild: - DONE
   BUILD BUILDROOT RPMS SRPMS - DONE
 - Packman scripts go to ~packman/bin - DONE
 - configuration goes to ~packman/etc - DONE
 - tmp stuff goes to ~packman/tmp - DONE
 - packman user .bashrc should have a nice PS1 and also PATH that includes /home/packman/bin and a few other useful aliases - IN PROGRESS
 - bash compeltion for git, yum, aptitude


 - Packman RPM package - IN PROGRESS
	- depend on lxc-docker
 - enable EPEL and RPMForge repos - DONE

 deb package:
 - depend on build-essential debhelper dh-make vim-nox wget unzip git lsb-release apt-transport-https ca-certificates lxc-docker
 - enable extra repos
   deb https://get.docker.com/ubuntu docker main

- disable docker iptables:
	mkdir /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
	cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/noiptables.conf
	[Service]
	ExecStart=
	ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker daemon -H fd:// --iptables=false
	EOF
	systemctl daemon-reload

- Setup scripts and response files for commonly used packages [MySQL comes to mind]

- Build generic templating mechanism based on dpkg's template mechanism only it would also allow setting a callback function for verifying inputs.
  - will support TUI and CLI

Things to think of:
 - if the package provides a daemon, need an init script/systemd template to start from

API:
- Read this:
	http://www.gajotres.net/best-available-php-restful-micro-frameworks/
	https://docs.phalconphp.com
- Needed APIs: 
	- create new package
	- create new build job
	- update build job status
	- query build job queue


- if we're generating a new package:
	- User inputs - DONE
		- get env matrix - i.e, on what distros this package should be built
		- get source URL
		- get version
		- write info to RC file
		- start a docker container of relevant distro



- analyze source for build and runtime dependencies
- if deps are from unofficial repos, need to appear in the report
- generate spec 
      - description
      - source URL
      - license - try to auto detect looking for files named license/i or copyright/i
      - arch - try to auto detect whether noarch/indep according to source type. For example, if the source is PHP||Perl||Python||many others only, then it is indep.
      - changelog
	- for deb we have debchange and dh-make already takes care of the initial import
	- need a parallel for RPM - DONE
      - auto detect config files
      - auto detect init scripts
      - dev package
      - maintainer 
	- check MAIL and DEBEMAIL ENV vars for email
	- check DEBFULLNAME and MAINTAINER_NAME for name
      - different profiles, different spec templates:
	- C/C++ one
	- PHP web apps
		- need an Apache config, potentially other common webservers
	- PHP extensions
	- is this package a daemon?
		- need an init template
		- create user for daemon

- source prep:
- remove {.git,.csv,.svn} files - DONE
- set proper permissions on files, i.e: remove redundant/add exec bit where needed - DONE
- deb only: repo name to place in changelog file

- SaaS demo:
	- Form with the same inputs as packman-new-package
	- Upon submit:
		- generate the RC file
		- commit and push to repo
		- call
